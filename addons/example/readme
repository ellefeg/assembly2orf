We can test assembly2orf (and any additional scripts) by using this exemplar dataset. We have the following files:

<pre>
example/
├── earth.fa
├── fire.fa
├── readme
├── sample_input
└── wind.fa
</pre>

`earth.fa`, `wind.fa` and `fire.fa` are nucleotide files which represent raw sequence output from Trinity. `sample_input` is a file telling assembly2orf which sequences to analyse.

To run the example, follow the `installation and pre-requisites` section in `assembly2orf/README.md`. Briefly:
* Download the package, install any third-party software required, make all scripts executable
* Check that `trigger-assembly2orf.sh` lists the correct `dependencies` folder
* 




5 to 6 minutes

1. Ensure the program is properly set up following the instructions in README.md

2. If necessary, edit column 2 of `sample_input` to the correct nucleotide file locations


2. Find these files:
* x
* y
* z

3. Run the program
```
./trigger-assembly2orf.sh {sample_input file} {working directory} {dependencies folder} {blast.dmnd} {blast.fa} > assembly2orf_nohup.out 2>&1&
```
