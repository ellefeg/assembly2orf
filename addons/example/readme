We can test assembly2orf (and any additional scripts) by using this exemplar dataset. We have the following files:

<pre>
example/
├── earth.fa
├── fire.fa
├── readme
├── sample_input
└── wind.fa
</pre>

`earth.fa`, `wind.fa` and `fire.fa` are nucleotide files which represent raw sequence output from Trinity. `sample_input` is a file telling assembly2orf which sequences to analyse.

If you are on Asellus in the directory /home/laura/scripts/assembly2orf/addons/example, simply run:

/home/laura/scripts/assembly2orf/trigger-assembly2orf.sh sample_input /home/laura/scripts/assembly2orf/addons/example /ngs/db/ensembl_metazoa/pep/allEnsemblMetazoa_pep.all.fa.fam.longest.dmnd /ngs/db/ensembl_metazoa/pep/allEnsemblMetazoa_pep.all.fa.fam.longest.fa {email}

If you are not on Asellus, follow the installation instructions in `assembly2orf/README.md`. Briefly:
* Download the package, install any third-party software required, make all scripts executable, check you have access to the Pfam-A file
* Check that `trigger-assembly2orf.sh` lists the correct `dependencies` folder

This example will take approximately 5 to 6 minutes to run.
