We can test assembly2orf by running this example file of 62 nucleotide sequences which were generated by running Trinity.

1. Ensure the program is properly set up following the instructions in README.md

2. If necessary, edit column 2 of `sample_input` to the correct nucleotide file locations


2. Find these files:
* x
* y
* z

3. Run the program
```
./trigger-assembly2orf.sh {sample_input file} {working directory} {dependencies folder} {blast.dmnd} {blast.fa} > assembly2orf_nohup.out 2>&1&
```
